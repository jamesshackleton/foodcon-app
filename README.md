Playing with Slack API and Python

Base code used for a basic Python Slackbot found [here](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html)

Probably not useful to you if you're not part of the bois

## YOU NEED TO ADD .env TO THE PROJECT ROOT AND ADD THE TOKEN (ASK @jamesshackleton FOR IT)

## Pre-requisites (I think)

**IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU ARE USING 3.6.5+!! WE HAD SOMEONE ON 3.6.4 AND IT DIDNT WORK DUE TO A BUG!!!!!**
* [Python 3.6.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/) - If you're a setting up Python for the first time, be sure to use the installer and ensure you install PIP and add Python to the PATH.
* PIP - Get that from installing Python
* virtualenv - Type the following command in a git BASH window `pip install virtualenv`
* slackclient - Type the following command in a git BASH window `pip install slackclient`
* Slack
